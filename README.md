# Project-Landing-Page
I am currently pursuing the "The Odin Project (TOP)" foundations course.
At this point of writing, I've finished the HTML5 & CSS3 lessons. 
This repo is a project to make a landing page and to demostrate my skills in HTML5 and CSS3.
What I'm proud about this project is it's mobile-first and responsive web development.
